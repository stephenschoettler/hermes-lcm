**Lossless Context Management plugin for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)**

> Bounded context, unbounded memory. Nothing is ever lost.

Based on the [LCM paper](https://papers.voltropy.com/LCM) by Ehrlich & Blackman (Voltropy PBC, Feb 2026).
Inspired by [lossless-claw](https://github.com/martian-engineering/lossless-claw) for OpenClaw.

## The Problem

When context fills up, agents replace your conversation with a flat lossy summary.
Details get lost. The model confidently misremembers. No way to go back.

## The Fix

Every message persisted. Hierarchical DAG summaries. Agent tools to drill back
into anything that was compacted.

## Why This Plugin

~5,000 lines of Python. Zero external dependencies. 192 tests that run standalone in under a second. Full lossless context management — immutable store, hierarchical DAG, agent retrieval tools, guided compression, assembly guardrails, session filtering — in a single lightweight plugin that drops into Hermes with no build step, no runtime overhead, and nothing to configure beyond `context.engine: lcm`.

## What It Does

- **Immutable store** — every message persisted in SQLite, never modified
- **Summary DAG** — hierarchical compaction (D0 minutes → D1 hours → D2 days)
- **3-level escalation** — L1 detailed → L2 bullets → L3 deterministic truncate (guaranteed convergence)
- **Agent tools** — `lcm_grep`, `lcm_describe`, `lcm_expand`, `lcm_expand_query` for structured retrieval
- **Current-turn search** — live messages ingested before tool execution
- **Session filtering** — exclude noisy sessions entirely or mark them read-only with glob patterns
- **Profile-scoped** — separate DB per Hermes profile

## Requirements

- Hermes Agent with the **pluggable context engine slot** ([PR #7464](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/7464))
- Python 3.11+
- No additional dependencies (uses Hermes auxiliary LLM for summarization)

## Install

```bash
# Clone into the context engine plugin directory
git clone https://github.com/stephenschoettler/hermes-lcm \
  ~/.hermes/hermes-agent/plugins/context_engine/lcm

# Or for a specific profile
git clone https://github.com/stephenschoettler/hermes-lcm \
  ~/.hermes/profiles/myprofile/hermes-agent/plugins/context_engine/lcm
```

## Update

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/hermes-agent/plugins/context_engine/lcm && git pull
```

Restart Hermes after updating.

> **Note:** Context engines must be installed under `plugins/context_engine/<name>/`,
> not `plugins/<name>/`. The general `~/.hermes/plugins/` directory is for tools,
> hooks, and CLI extensions — context engines are discovered separately.

Restart Hermes. Activate the engine — either via the interactive UI or config file:

**Option A — `hermes plugins` UI:**

```
hermes plugins
```

The composite plugins screen shows provider categories at the bottom.
Select **Context Engine** and pick `lcm` from the radiolist.

**Option B — config.yaml:**

```yaml
context:
  engine: lcm
```

Verify with `hermes plugins`:

```
Plugins (1):
  ✓ hermes-lcm v0.4.0 (6 tools)

Provider Plugins:
  Context Engine: lcm
```

## Configuration

Environment variables (all optional):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT` | `64` | Recent messages protected from compaction |
| `LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS` | `20000` | Token threshold floor for leaf compaction |
| `LCM_DYNAMIC_LEAF_CHUNK_ENABLED` | `false` | Opt-in dynamic oldest-chunk sizing instead of always compacting the full raw backlog outside the fresh tail |
| `LCM_DYNAMIC_LEAF_CHUNK_MAX` | `50000` | Upper bound for dynamic leaf chunk sizing |
| `LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` | `0.75` | Fraction of context window triggering compaction |
| `LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH` | `1` | Max condensation depth (`0` = disabled, `-1` = unlimited) |
| `LCM_CONDENSATION_FANIN` | `4` | Same-depth nodes needed to trigger condensation |
| `LCM_CACHE_FRIENDLY_CONDENSATION_ENABLED` | `false` | Opt-in suppression of low-value follow-on condensation after a leaf pass |
| `LCM_CACHE_FRIENDLY_MIN_DEBT_GROUPS` | `2` | Debt threshold multiplier before cache-friendly gating allows a follow-on condensation pass |
| `LCM_IGNORE_SESSION_PATTERNS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated glob patterns for sessions to exclude from LCM storage entirely |
| `LCM_STATELESS_SESSION_PATTERNS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated glob patterns for sessions that stay read-only (`platform:session_id` matching supported) |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL` | *(auxiliary)* | Override model for summarization |
| `LCM_EXPANSION_MODEL` | *(summary model / auxiliary)* | Override model for `lcm_expand_query` synthesis |
| `LCM_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | Timeout for a single model-backed summarization call |
| `LCM_EXPANSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Timeout for `lcm_expand_query` answer synthesis |
| `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` | `~/.hermes/lcm.db` | SQLite database path (auto profile-scoped) |
| `LCM_NEW_SESSION_RETAIN_DEPTH` | `2` | DAG depth retained after `/new` (`-1` = all, `0` = none, `2` = keep d2+) |

The point-8 compaction knobs are intentionally opt-in. `cache_friendly_*` is a plugin-local prompt-stability heuristic, not a claim that Hermes currently passes true prompt-cache metrics into `hermes-lcm`.

Pattern syntax matches `lossless-claw`:
- `*` matches within one colon-delimited segment
- `**` can span across colons

Hermes currently matches each pattern against multiple candidate keys for flexibility:
- raw `session_id`
- `platform`
- `platform:session_id`

That means patterns like `cron:*` can catch Hermes cron sessions today, while plain raw session-id matching still works if you know the exact IDs you want to target.

## Agent Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lcm_grep` | Search raw messages AND summaries across all depths. FTS5 syntax. |
| `lcm_describe` | Inspect DAG structure — token counts, children, expand hints. No node_id = session overview. |
| `lcm_expand` | Recover original content from a summary node. Token-budgeted. |
| `lcm_expand_query` | Answer a question from expanded LCM context using either a query or explicit node_ids. Uses the expansion path/model instead of the summarization path. |
| `lcm_status` | Quick health overview — compression count, store size, DAG depth distribution, context usage, and active config. |
| `lcm_doctor` | Run diagnostics — database integrity, FTS index sync, orphaned nodes, config validation, context pressure. |

## Gateway Slash Commands

When Hermes host support for plugin slash commands is available, `hermes-lcm` also exposes a `/lcm` operator surface for quick read-only diagnostics from chat:

- `/lcm` or `/lcm status` — current session/runtime status
- `/lcm doctor` — SQLite + FTS health checks and store/node totals
- `/lcm doctor clean` — best-effort read-only scan for obvious junk/noise sessions matched from stored session keys
- `/lcm backup` — create a timestamped SQLite backup before any future cleanup workflow

`/lcm doctor clean apply` is intentionally not implemented yet. This slice is diagnostics-first and backup-first.

## How It Works

1. **Ingest** — every message persisted verbatim in an immutable SQLite store
2. **Compact** — when context pressure builds, older messages outside the fresh tail are summarized into D0 leaf nodes
3. **Condense** — when enough D0 nodes accumulate, they're condensed into D1 nodes (and so on up)
4. **Escalate** — if a summary is too long, escalate: L1 detailed → L2 bullets → L3 deterministic truncate
5. **Assemble** — active context = system prompt + highest-depth summaries + fresh tail
6. **Retrieve** — agent uses `lcm_grep`/`lcm_describe`/`lcm_expand`/`lcm_expand_query` to drill into compacted history or synthesize answers from expanded context

**Running tests:**

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

No Hermes Agent checkout required — the test suite includes a lightweight ABC stub so it runs standalone.

## Context Engine Slot

Requires the **pluggable context engine slot** — an ABC (`ContextEngine`) in
hermes-agent core that makes the `ContextCompressor` swappable via the plugin
system. Config-driven selection via `context.engine` in config.yaml, with a
`plugins/context_engine/` discovery directory. Same pattern as OpenClaw's
`contextEngine` slot + `lossless-claw`.
