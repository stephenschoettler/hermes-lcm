"""SQLite lock-contention helpers shared by the LCM engine.

Isolated from ``engine.py`` (WS5 seam): detecting SQLite lock-contention error
chains and temporarily bounding ``busy_timeout`` on gateway-critical paths are a
cohesive, pure SQLite concern with no engine state. ``engine.py`` imports the
two entry points it calls; the busy-timeout probe travels with them. Callers
keep their own policy constants (for example the session-end timeout budget).
